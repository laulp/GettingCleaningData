# GettingCleaningData
Course project

The script 'run_analysis.R' have to be run in a directory containing the whole 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset' unziped.

The data can be downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The code performs the following steps (explains with more detail in the Code Book)
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
